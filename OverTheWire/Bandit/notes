		Network Setuid
	-run the setuid binary to establish a connection to a random port
	-on a seperate terminal use ncat -lc to listen to that port and send the password of the current level to it
	-nc will return the password to the next level
Bandit 21->22
		Cron
	- crontab -l doesnt work so we go into /etc/cron.d/ to find a script being run by bandit 22
	- this script moves a file into the tmp/ directory
	- we have access to tmp/ and this is where the password is
Bandit 22->23
		Cron
	- same as last level, find the /etc/cron.d/ script that is running
	-cat the script and use it to find the tmp directory where the password is held	
Bandit 23->24
		.sh script
	-executible stored in /etc/cron.d has bandit24 premisions and scans a directory and runs and deletes all the files in it
	-we make our own .sh script and place it in the directory so that the executible when cron runs it copys the next password into our tmp/i
Bandit 24->25
	make a shell script to create all possible passcodes
	run cat allpass.txt | nc localhost 30002  to try all the passcodes on the port 30002 on localhost, to get the next password
Bandit 25->26
	the shell for bandit26 is not /bin/bash
	the welcome message uses more to print
	trigger more, and use more commands to enter vim and read /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26
Bandit 26->27
	use the method from before to get into bandit26
	use $set shell=/bin/bash to get into the bandit26 bash
	use the bandit27 binary to print the password
Bandit 27->28
	use the git clone command for the ssh link in your /tmp directory
	password is in the readme
Bandit 28->29
	goal is to find the password through ssh in a git repo
