The challenge gives us an encrypted flag and an encrypted piece of text
We will be able to use this encryped piece of text to get the key and decipher the flag

Part 1:
It looks to me like some sort of substitution cipher was used
I will start by doing frequency analysis on the text, but keeping in mind that the text may not be english 
	Looking at a frequency analysis tool the 5 most used letters are: 
		T-13.6%
		F-11.9%
		L-8.5%
		W-8.5%
		K-6.8%
	Since the distribution isnt uniform, we know this cannot be a vigenere cipher, and is likely some kind of monoalphabetic substitution cipher
	I have a hunch that this is spanish, since it has a similar frequency distribution
	this text also has some 3 letter words: "xgf" "ERW" "wfr" "ELW"
	Some common spanish 3 letter words are: "que" "los" "las" "del"
	Maybe "ERW"->"los" and "ELW"->"las" or vice versa
	lets translate these letters in these words using tr
	this didnt help very much
	lets try substituting the top 5 most used letters in spanish, matching them up with the cipherletter counterparts
	E-13.1%
	A-12.9%
	O-9.3%
	S-7.5%
	N-6.8%
